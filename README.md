# Audiora üé∂

A music-based matchmaking app that connects people through their taste in music ‚Äî think Tinder, but powered by playlists and favorite tracks.

---

## How It's Made
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, C# (.NET)

We will build the frontend with **React** (using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and the backend with **C#/.NET**. The goal is to let users create profiles, share music preferences, and discover compatible matches. Frontend and backend will communicate so we can handle core flows like sign up, browsing, and matching.

> Note: The project is in progress ‚Äî we‚Äôre focusing on getting the core experience working first, then polishing UI/UX.

## Planned Features (more in the future)

- Browse/discover people with similar taste
- Basic matching based on music overlap
- Simple authentication and profile editing
